# Frame_Mock
Frame Mock is a software that manages creation of mock objects in Python code.

The project is a continuation of the previous version realized on my old git account.

The software is addressed for Python projects in order to help creation and management of mock objects in unit-tests.
The tool allows to replace as a mock:
- classes
- class methods and fields
- functions and global variables
